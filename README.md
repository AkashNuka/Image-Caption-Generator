# Image Caption Generator Website

## Overview
The **Image Caption Generator Website** is a dynamic application designed to provide descriptive captions for uploaded images. Built with cutting-edge machine learning techniques, the platform leverages an image captioning model trained on the SBU Captions dataset to generate captions based on image content. Users can upload images and receive contextually relevant captions.

## Features
- **Image Upload**: Upload images directly via the website.
- **Caption Generation**: Automatic generation of descriptive captions for uploaded images.
- **State-of-the-Art Model**: Powered by PyTorch, Vision Transformers, and a Transformer-based decoder.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for easy usage.
